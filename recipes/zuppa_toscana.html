    <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
        <p>
            If you haven't tried this soup yet, now is your chance. It's popular for a reason. 
            It's easy to make, very satisfying, and feels like a treat. Probably because it has 
            bacon. And sausage. And cream. And potatoes. The kale totally cancels out the calories 
            from the sausage and bacon so you can feel good about eating this. I wish.
        </p>
    <h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (17.6 ounce) pack Italian sausages</li>
            <li>5 strips of bacon (thick cut works best)</li>
            <li>1 medium onion chopped</li>
            <li>5 cloves garlic minced</li>
            <li>2 cups chicken broth (beef works too)</li>
            <li>4 cups water</li>
            <li>4 large red potatoes roughly cubed (leave skins on)</li>
            <li>1 dash Italian seasoning</li>
            <li>1 cup heavy/whipping cream</li>
            <li>1 small bunch of kale torn into bite-size pieces (remove stems)</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>STEPS</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Using kitchen shears (or a knife), cut the bacon into small pieces and add it to the pot. Cook the bacon for a few minutes over medium-high heat. I like to give the bacon a bit of a head start so it gets nice and crispy.</li>
            <li>Take the sausages out of their casings. I lightly slice the sausages length-wise with a sharp knife to make a slit in the casings, and then it's really easy to get them out. I then use my fingers to break the meat into bite-size pieces and add them to the soup pot as I go.</li>
            <li>>While the sausages and bacon cook, I chop the onion and potatoes, making sure to give the pot a stir occasionally.</li>
            <li>When the sausages and bacon are nicely browned and getting crispy, stir in the onions and garlic. Cook for 2-3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the chicken stock, water, potatoes, and Italian seasoning to the pot.</li>
            <li>Bring soup to a boil and then reduce to medium-low heat to simmer.</li>
            <li>Cook for 10-15 minutes or until potatoes and onions are tender.</li>
            <li>Add kale, cream, and salt and pepper and cook for a further 5-10 minutes or until the kale is soft and wilted.</li>
        </ol>
